Enyo Native Hybrid Applications
-------------------------------

Early testing, of Enyo 2.6 modular running under NodeJS and driving Qt interfaces.


Requirements
------------

Due to the experimental nature of this, the requirements below are pretty strict.


** Description of my hackathon project
-------------------------------------
Using a distributable runtime of Qt 4.8, Node 10.35, and Enyo 2.6, I have added support for `write once, run everywhere`.
The main showcase is not the painting app, but the underlying controls, and bindings to the Qt Framework, as well as the
browser.


** Team Member Names
-------------------
Derek Anderson


** What environment does it need to run
--------------------------------------
The built file will work in Chrome (latest used for development), for native support, only OSX with Node 10.35, and Qt 4.8 was tested.



** How to build my code
-----------------------

* Node v0.10.39
* Enyo-Dev at commit (https://github.com/enyojs/enyo-dev/commit/3437da02a3dfb133ef89af5a4f987d6212f0f43d)
* Clone this code
* npm install
* epack


** How to deploy or run my code
------------------------------

* run output.js in browser with index.html in dist dir
* run node output.js from the dist dir to see native output used
